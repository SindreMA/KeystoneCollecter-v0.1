# Keystone Collector

## Description

This is the first version of keystone collector that became bestkeystone.com.
It is a simple script that collects data from Raider.io and stores it in a json file.

The first version of the website was a simple html page that used the json file to display the data.

This is super outdated, now it fetches data directly from Blizzard's API and stores it in a database.
